# Introduction
This is a simple **Fiji macro** that I used to evaluate how the leaf is damaged by salt stress treamtent in my PhD. research.

Basically, this macro screens through all the files each containing a single photo of a single leaf, and evaluates the total area of the leaf and the damaged(senescenced) area and output the data in a table. You can proceed visualize the proportion of damaged(senescenced) using R or Python etc.

In this repository, I will give a standalone version of this macro proccessing a single photo, along with one that processes a list of files. And a R program for visualization of the data.

**Note**: It is recommended that photos of the leaves are taken in *the same environment* (e.g., with the same background) using a *dedicated camera* rather than a phone, to ensure consistent and unified image quality.
